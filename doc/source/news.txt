.. _release-2-1-1:

Release 2.1.1 - 2012/12/29
--------------------------

This is bug fix release of 2.1.0. All of 2.1.0 users should use 2.1.1
instead.

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug that ``KEY_NORMALIZE`` information in database that is
  created by groonga 2.0.8 or ealier is dropped.

.. _release-2-1-0:

Release 2.1.0 - 2012/12/29
--------------------------

.. Caution::

   Use 2.1.1 instead of 2.1.0. 2.1.0 has a serious bug related
   ``KEY_NORMALIZE``.

.. Caution::

   This release has backward incompatible changes against ``table_list`` and
   ``column_list`` commands. If you use own program which depends on the output
   results above commands, you need to support null instead of "null" string.

   This release has supported ``--normalizer`` option, but there is
   side effect for this feature. If you open old version of groonga
   database at least once, you can not open its database by old
   version of groonga.

   There is also another backward incompatible change agaist plugin API for
   tokenizer. The argument of ``grn_tokenizer_query_open`` API has changed.
   This API change affects developer of tokenizer plugin.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [doc] Added documentation about :ref:`nested-index-search`.
* Supported the expression as :doc:`/reference/functions/snippet_html` arguments.
  This change enables you to use ``snippet_html("STRING" + "STRING")`` for example.
  You can specify column name or literal for "STRING". [Reported by Tomoatsu Shimada]
* Supported to create own normalizer as a plugin.
* Moved ``groonga-query-log-analyzer`` as
  `groonga-query-log <http://rubygems.org/gems/groonga-query-log>`_ RubyGems.
  It enables you to analyze query logs without installing groonga package.
* Supported ``--normalizer`` option for :doc:`/reference/commands/table_create` command.
  This change enables you to specify normalizer plugin.
* Changed "null" string to null value as meaning for "No Object".
  This is backward incompatible change and affects output results of introspection
  related commands such as ``table_list`` and ``column_list``.
* Added a flag which controls behavior about normalizer as the last argument
  of ``grn_tokenizer_query_open`` API.
* Supported continuous line in :ref:`command-list-with-continuous-line` list.
* Improved to support not only no key table, but also hash table, patricia trie
  and double array trie for :ref:`nested-index-search`.

Fixes
^^^^^

* [windows] Added missing ``O_BINARY`` flag to open file correctly.
  This change fixes the infinite loop problem about groonga HTTP server.
  [GitHub#47] [Patch by Shimomura Tatsuya]
* Fixed a bug that ``--default-match-escalation-threshold`` doesn't accept
  negative value to disable functionality.
  This fix enable you to disable search escalation.
  see :option:`--default-match-escalation-threshold` about details.
* Fixed a bug that ``_score`` after "*" is ignored in ``--output_columns``.

Release 2.0.9 - 2012/11/29
--------------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

  in ``geo_distance`` with ``rectangle`` as approximate type. [#1534]
* [doc] Added the :doc:`/spec/gqtp` specification.
* Improved to ignore non critical ``getaddrinfo()`` error which groonga command emits on startup.
  This change does not affects nomal use of groonga because it just checked whether default hostname
  is resolved in previous version.
* [experimental] Added ``snippet_html()`` function which extract keyword and surrounding text.
  See :doc:`/reference/functions/snippet_html` about details.
* Supported to report error reason when error occured during reading table record.
* Supported to search with keyword by nested index notation ( concatinate multiple 
  indexed column name with dot character ) if there is a relationship between
  multiple table with index.
* Supported to log "[tokenizer][mecab]" tag when using ``TokenMecab`` tokenizer.
* Supported to log "[tokenizer][kytea]" tag when using ``TokenKyTea`` tokenizer.
* Improved to use separated array for command error location as output results.
  This change is incompatibility change, but does not affects existing program.
* Added documentation for :doc:`/reference/command/output_format`.
* Added documentation for :doc:`/reference/command/return_code` of output results.
* Supported range search by using index.

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed to use network byte order for status code of :ref:`gqtp-header-spec` to follow
  the normal network protocol convention.
  This change affects that groonga <= 2.0.8 client which connects to groonga server 2.0.9
  or later can not show status code properly when command failed.
* Fixed a bug that UTF-8 normalization computes wrong offset which affects to return value
  of ``snippet_html()``. This change not to insert tag of snippet into invalid location.
  [#1531] [Reported by Tomoatsu Shimada]
* [windows] Fixed over allocated memory access which cause segmentation fault
  on startup by groonga command. [#1532] [Patch by Akio Tajima]

  stored in column exceeds 128MB. [groonga-dev,01088] [Reported by ongaeshi]
* Fixed a bug that searching with indexed column for ``Int*`` and ``UInt*`` 
  except ``Int32/Uint32`` returns invalid results.
* Fixed a bug that deleting record can be found.
* Fixed a bug that latin1 and koi8r normalizations could not process all string data
  if given string contains NULL character on the way.
* Fixed to return the correct default value of type when no data stored in column is
  referenced by ``select`` command.
* Fixed to exclude the value of vector column metadata in :ref:`offline-index-construction`.
  This change not to contain such a metadata as search results.
